# Komuniteti Admin App Implementation Summary

Based on the core modules documentation and project requirements, we've implemented a context-based architecture with role-specific navigation for the Komuniteti Admin App. 

## Architectural Changes

### 1. Context Management
- Created a Redux context slice to manage business accounts and buildings
- Implemented context switching for both user types: Business Managers and Administrators
- Added context loading actions and hooks for loading data based on user role
- Built a custom hook (useContextData) for unified context state access

### 2. Header with Context Switcher
- Implemented an AppHeader component with integrated context switcher
- Created a ContextSwitcher component that adapts based on user role
- Business Managers can switch between business accounts
- Administrators can switch between assigned buildings
- Added visual feedback to show the current active context

### 3. Context-Aware UI Components
- Created a ContextScreenWrapper component for consistent context-aware screens
- Implemented a ContextFilter component for filtering data based on current context
- Built context-sensitive displays that adapt content based on user role
- Added role-specific data loading and filtering logic

### 4. Dashboard Screens
- Updated Business Manager dashboard to display current business account context
- Created Administrator dashboard to display current building context
- Both dashboards automatically load appropriate context data on mount
- Added pull-to-refresh functionality that also refreshes context data

### 5. Navigation Structure
- Maintained bottom tab navigation for main app sections
- Moved business/building selection to the header as a dropdown
- Updated RootNavigator to load context data on authentication
- Screens adapt their content based on the selected context

### 6. Units Management for Administrators
- Added a dedicated Units tab to the administrator navigation
- Implemented screens for viewing and managing units based on the hierarchy in core modules
- Created separate screens for Residential Units and Business Units
- Added a BuildingUnits screen that shows all units in a building
- Connected Units management to the Administrator Dashboard via Quick Actions
- Implemented context-aware filtering for units based on the current building

## Implementation Details

### Redux State Management
- Added `contextSlice.ts` for storing and managing context data
- Implemented actions for setting and switching contexts
- Created mock data services for business accounts and buildings
- Context changes trigger appropriate data reloading

### Context Switching UX
- Created dropdown menu for context selection in header
- Added visual indication of the current context
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing for context objects
- Improved ContextSwitcher with context count and visual enhancements

### Context-Based Filtering
- Built filtering system that adapts based on user role:
  - Business Managers can filter across buildings
  - Administrators automatically see only their building's data
- Implemented consistent filtering UI with chips
- Filter state persists during navigation

### Role-Based UI
- Each user type has a specific dashboard tailored to their role
- UI components adapt based on the current user role
- Screens display data specific to the selected context
- Residents list demonstrates context-aware filtering

### Units Management Structure
- Implemented hierarchy matching the core modules documentation:
  - Buildings contain both Residential Units and Business Units
  - Administrators can manage all units within their assigned buildings
  - Units categorized by type (residential/commercial/storage/parking)
  - Each unit type has specific attributes and management features

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Data Loading
- Implement context-specific data prefetching
- Add caching strategies for previously viewed contexts
- Support offline mode with cached context data

### 2. Notifications
- Make notifications context-aware (filter by current business/building)
- Add ability to create notifications targeted to specific contexts

### 3. UX/UI Improvements
- Add context navigation history for quick switching
- Implement animations for context transitions
- Add visual indicators for context-specific data availability

This implementation follows the hierarchical structure outlined in the core modules documentation while providing an intuitive user experience for both Business Managers and Administrators.
