```

- **Business Manager** is the top-level role with complete access to all platform features and data. Business managers can manage all buildings, assign administrators, and switch between different business accounts.

- **Administrator** is a subordinate role with limited access to only the buildings they've been assigned to by a business manager. Administrators can manage building units, residents, payments, and other building-specific operations, and can switch between different building accounts.

The relationship between these roles is established through assignment, where business managers explicitly delegate building management responsibilities to administrators through the platform.
