## Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Created elevation system with standardized levels in src/theme/elevation.ts
2. ✅ Implemented elevation system in core UI components
3. ✅ Applied theme tokens to typography and colors
4. ✅ Fixed Surface elevation props to use consistent approach
5. ✅ Added success color to theme (fixed hardcoded values)
6. ✅ Created AppHeader component with proper platform-specific elevation
7. ✅ Created showcase screen for MD3 elevation system demonstration
8. ✅ Migrated chat components with MD3 styling and animations
9. ✅ Created reusable DialogContainer with MD3 styling and animations
10. ✅ Created reusable FloatingActionButton with MD3 elevation and animations

## Next Steps
1. Continue updating screen layouts with theme tokens
2. ~~Apply elevation system to remaining components (Dialogs, FABs)~~ (Completed)
3. Test all components in dark mode
4. Create visual regression test suite
5. Standardize typography across app to use MD3 type scale
6. Update remaining instances of dialogs and FABs across the app to use new components

## Known Issues
- ~~React Native Paper Appbar.Header doesn't fully support the elevation prop directly~~ (Fixed with new AppHeader component)
- ~~Success color not available in theme - need to add to theme types~~ (Fixed by adding to theme)
